> A codec for framing AsyncRead/AsyncWrite from the futures lib with serde-cbor

This rust crate integrates the [`serde-cbor`](https://crates.io/crates/serde-cbor) into a codec
(`Decoder` and `Encoder`) of [`future-codec`](https://crates.io/crates/futures-codec). This allows
turning an AsyncRead/AsyncWrite into a stream and sink of rust objects that implement Serialize/Deserialize from serde.

This is a fork from [tokio-serde-cbor](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-serde-cbor).
It turned out to work unchanged for futures-codec. All the credit for this functionality should go to @vorner.

### Upgrade

Please check out the [changelog](https://github.com/najamelan/futures_cbor_codec/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) when upgrading.

### Dependencies

This crate has few dependiencies. Cargo will automatically handle it's dependencies for you.

There are no optional features.


## Usage

This crate provides a codec for framing information as CBOR encoded messages. It allows
encoding and decoding arbitrary [serde](https://serde.rs) ready types. It can be used by
plugging the codec into the connection's `framed` method to get stream and sink of the desired
items.

The encoded and decoded items are independent (you may want to encode references and decode
owned data, or the protocol might be asymetric). If you want just one direction, you can use
[`Decoder`] or [`Encoder`]. If you want both, you better use [`Codec`].

Note that this is useful if the CBOR itself defines the frames. If the messages are delimited
in some other way (eg. length-prefix encoding) and CBOR is only the payload, you'd use a codec
for the other framing and use `.map` on the received stream and sink to convert the messages.

Please have a look in the [examples directory of the repository](https://github.com/najamelan/futures_cbor_codec/tree/master/examples).

This crate works on WASM.


### Basic example
```rust
use
{
   futures_ringbuf    :: { *                                      } ,
   futures            :: { SinkExt, StreamExt, executor::block_on } ,
   asynchronous_codec :: { Framed                                 } ,
   futures_cbor_codec :: { Codec                                  } ,
   std                :: { collections::HashMap                   } ,
};


// We create some test data to serialize. This works because Serde implements
// Serialize and Deserialize for HashMap, so the codec can frame this type.
//
type TestData = HashMap<String, usize>;


/// Something to test with. It doesn't really matter what it is.
//
fn test_data() -> TestData
{
   let mut data = HashMap::new();

   data.insert( "hello".to_string(), 42 );
   data.insert( "world".to_string(), 0  );

   data
}


// In a real life scenario the sending and receiving end usually are in different processes.
// We could simulate that somewhat by putting them in separate async blocks and spawning those,
// but since we only send in one direction, I chose to keep it simple.
//
// Obviously in production code you should do some real error handling rather than using
// `expect`. However for this example, almost any error would fatal, so we might as well.
//
fn main()
{
   let program = async
   {
      let mock = RingBuffer::new(32);

      // Type annotations are needed unfortunately.
      //
      let (mut writer, mut reader) = Framed::new( mock , Codec::<TestData, TestData>::new() ).split();

      writer.send( test_data() ).await.expect( "send message1" );
      writer.send( test_data() ).await.expect( "send message2" );
      writer.close().await.expect( "close sender" );


      while let Some(msg) = reader.next().await.transpose().expect( "receive message" )
      {
         println!( "Received: {:#?}", msg );
      }
   };

   block_on( program );
}
```
